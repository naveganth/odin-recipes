    <img width="300" src="../images/cachorroquente.jpg" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These Brazilian Hot Dogs are a classic Brazilian childhood favorite!
      They're a special treat that's easy to make and tastes oh-so-special.
      They're cooked in a tomato sauce with veggies to elevate their flavors and
      can be topped with a ton of fun stuff, from the sauce they're cooked in to
      Parmesan cheese, some <em>Batata Palha</em> potato sticks, or anything you
      like!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>10 hot dogs</li>
      <li>10 hot dog buns</li>
      <li>1 small onion, sliced or 1/2 of a large one</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, seeded and sliced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Brazilian Sofrito or 2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1.5 cups marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Using a paring knife, make a slit down the middle of each of the hot
        dogs and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>In a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.</li>
      <li>
        When the butter is melted, add the chopped onions and the bell peppers.
        Sautee until the onions are transparent, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add in the garlic, and sautee until it's fragrant, about 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the marinara sauce and the water, and stir to combine, then
        submerge the hot dogs in the sauce. Bring to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>Simmer the hot dogs for 5-10 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Place the cooked hot dogs in the buns, and top with the sauce, a
        sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, and potato sticks to taste. Dress with
        mayo, ketchup and mustard, if desired!
      </li>
    </ol>
